    "abstract": "PixLift reduces mobile/web data usage by requesting smaller images and upscaling them on-device with AI. Deployed as a Chromium extension and evaluated across 71.4k webpages, it finds ~10% partial and ~1.5% full server support for remote downscaling. With client-side super-resolution (QuickSRNet, SR Sub-Pixel CNN, SESR-M5), PixLift achieves median page-load time reductions of ~7s under developing-region network conditions while keeping quality acceptable in a 100-user study.",
